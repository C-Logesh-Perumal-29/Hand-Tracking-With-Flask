# Hand-Tracking-With-Flask
This project implements a real-time hand tracking web application using Flask, Mediapipe, and OpenCV. The application captures video from the user's camera and utilizes the Mediapipe library to detect and track hand landmarks. The processed video stream is then displayed on a web page using Flask.
